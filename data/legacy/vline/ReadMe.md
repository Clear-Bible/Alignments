# `vline` Corpus Files

This directory has Plain text versions of the (open) target texts, one verse per line
(`vline` format). The versification scheme depends on the language and
edition, and so is specific as a prefix in the filename according to
this pattern:

<versification>_<canon>_<edition>.txt

For the OT ... <TBD>

For the NT, these follow the `eng` versification, since it is the most
inclusive. If an edition omits certain verses, a blank line is
inserted so that `vref` and `vline` files can be processed in tandem.
