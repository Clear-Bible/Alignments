# GNT Corpora

### SBLGNT

As downloaded from
https://github.com/LogosBible/SBLGNT/tree/master/data/sblgnt/text
circa July 2023. This includes punctuation.

Note this is the **latest** version of the SBLGNT from Logos, which
_includes_ John 7:53-8:11 (the _pericopae adulterae_), unlike the
earlier original version and print copies. It is otherwise the same
text as the original.

The "official" SBLGNT omits 18 verses for text-critical reasons:

* Matt 17:21
* Matt 18:11
* Matt 23:14
* Mark 7:16
* Mark 9:44
* Mark 9:46
* Mark 11:26
* Mark 15:28
* Luke 17:36
* Luke 23:17
* John 5:4
* Acts 8:37
* Acts 15:34
* Acts 24:7
* Acts 28:29
* Rom 16:25-27

These verses are part of the `org` versification, so blank links are
added for synchronization.

### SBLGNTNoPunct

Created by concatenating the tokens in sources/SBLGNT.tsv. This
therefore lacks punctuation.
