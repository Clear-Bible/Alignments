# Russian Target Corpora

## RUSSYN

This is the public domain version of the Russian Synodal Version, not
to be confused with [the copyright-protected 1994 version from
DBL](https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=6ede4093fc1b7c5d#). 

Downloaded 2024-02-27 from
https://github.com/BibleNLP/ebible/blob/main/corpus/rus-russyn.txt in
`vref` format. 

The orignal had blank lines corresponding to Deuterocanon books, which were
not included. 

Sean removed the blank lines, and split this into `nt_RUSSYN.txt` and
`ot_RUSSYN.txt`, with some guesswork and help from Google
Translate. These appear to match (the length of the) `org`
versification scheme.
