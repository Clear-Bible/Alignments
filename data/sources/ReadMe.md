# Source Language Texts

## `vref` Format

One verse per line, synchronized with the `org` reference scheme
unless otherwise noted. You can identify verses by using the
appropriate file from references/*-ref.txt as an index: the line
numbers should be the same.

In many cases punctuation has been stripped, so not necessarily
character-equivalent to the published text. 

## 'GrapeCity' Format

Numerous files have one token per line, with additional linguistic
information (lemma, gloss, part of speech, etc.). See [Source Text
Formats](../../docs/sourceformats.md) in the documentation for
additional information.
