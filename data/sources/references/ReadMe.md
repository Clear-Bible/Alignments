These files make explicit the verse numbers for specific versions in
vline format in the parent directory, using USFM references.

## Reference (`ref`) files

There are three files, one for each major canon division, together
representing the content of vref.txt file from
https://github.com/BibleNLP/ebible/blob/main/metadata/vref.txt , one
strong candidate for a standard list of verses. These contain a full
set of references, one per line, in USFM format. 

* `vref-ot-refline.txt`: the Old Testament canon
* `vref-nt-refline.txt`: the New Testament canon
* `vref-dc-refline.txt`: the Deuterocanonical books


## SBLGNT-ref.txt

This file contains the references from the published SBLGNT
(https://github.com/LogosBible/SBLGNT/tree/master/data/sblgnt/text). 

There are 30 verses that are present in some versions (including vref.txt) but are
absent from the SBLGNT, reflecting different text-critical decisions
by the editor. 

Blanks lines have been added for these in SBLGNT-vref.txt in the
parent directory, to synchronize that file with nt-ref.txt.
