# Contributing Alignments

We welcome all contributions of Bible alignments. While those those based
on openly-licensed texts have the most opportunities for reuse,
alignments based on copyrighted texts are also welcome. However, we do
not provide digital rights management, and therefore cannot share
copyrighted texts. As long as the words are replaced with identifiers
so the text cannot be reproduced, we can host the data. 

## Formatting Contributed Alignments

See [Formats](formats.md) for details on the supported alignment
formats. 

If you need help formatting your data, contact us: we may have
existing tools that will help.
