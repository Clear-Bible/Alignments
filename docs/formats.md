# Alignment Formats

Multiple formats are currently used in the community for alignment
data. While a single shared standard would be desirable for sharing
data, and we hope one will be developed, in the meantime we will
support data in a variety of formats. 

Here's a list of currently recognized formats. If you have alignment
data in a different format, please let us know so we can add it. 

* Pharoah format
* List-of-lists format: 

## Other Formats

Other formats include useful information for alignment
purposes but are not fully-specified alignments:

* (Reverse) interlinear format: this indicates a source lemma for a
  target word, or vice versa. However, when words are repeated in a
  sentence or verse, such formats do not specify which instance is
  aligned with which, so the alignments are ambiguous.[^1]


[^1]: Hueristics might help to convert such data to a complete
    alignment. How well this works is likely to depend on the
    languages involved.
