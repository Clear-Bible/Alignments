# Alignments

This is a repository of Bible text alignments, including both
automatic alignments and manually-corrected alignments. The goal is to
provide a central location that others can both contribute to and take
advantage of. 

## Principles

* This repository is for alignment data. Other kinds of data
  (especially Bible texts themselves) should be maintained elsewhere
  (see [Other Resources](resources.md)) and referenced here,
  preferably by a specific version identifier.
* The primary focus of this repository is _openly-licensed_ data.
    * The preferred license is [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
      International License (CC-BY)][cc-by]. 
    * Other open license types are also allowed ([CC
      BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and
      others)
    * Note that Clear is not able to enforce any license terms, so do not
      upload materials unless you are willing to share them.
    * "Freely you have received; freely give." ([Matt 10:8, NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MAT.10.8.NIV))
* While one alignment pair is sufficient to unlock aligned resources
  for a language, we want to support multiple pairs where they are available.
* More data is better, but some data is better than none. So please
  upload relevant data and metadata, even if it's not complete, and
  add or correct data where you can.
