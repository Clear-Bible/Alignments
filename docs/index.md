# Alignments

This is a repository of Bible text alignments, including both
automatic alignments and manually-corrected alignments. The goal is to
provide a central location that others can both contribute to and take
advantage of. 

The documentation follows the best practice for project documentation
as described by Daniele Procida in the [Di√°taxis documentation
framework](https://diataxis.fr/) and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides/index.md)
3. [Reference](reference/index.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation/index.md)
